# Project Migration from Lovable to Replit

## Overview
This is a full-stack JavaScript application that has been migrated from Lovable to the Replit environment. The project appears to be a web application with space/astronomy theming, featuring user authentication via Supabase, navigation, hero sections, features, and tutorials.

## Project Architecture
- **Frontend**: React with TypeScript, using wouter for routing (converted from React Router)
- **Backend**: Express.js server with TypeScript
- **Database**: Supabase PostgreSQL (using existing user database with SupabaseStorage)
- **Authentication**: Supabase authentication integration with Discord OAuth
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with shadcn/ui components and custom space theme
- **Build Tool**: Vite with custom server setup

## Current Status
- [x] Dependencies installed (react-router-dom, @fortawesome packages, sonner, @supabase/supabase-js)
- [ ] Project structure adapted for Replit compatibility
- [ ] Routing system converted from React Router to wouter
- [ ] Environment variables and Supabase integration secured
- [ ] Application tested and verified working

## Key Components
- StarField background animation
- Navigation with authentication state
- Hero, Features, and Tutorials sections
- User authentication flow with Supabase

## Security Considerations
- Client/server separation maintained
- Environment variables properly configured for frontend (VITE_ prefix)
