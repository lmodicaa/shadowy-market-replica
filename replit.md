# Project Migration from Lovable to Replit

## Overview
This is a full-stack JavaScript application that has been migrated from Lovable to the Replit environment. The project appears to be a web application with space/astronomy theming, featuring user authentication via Supabase, navigation, hero sections, features, and tutorials.

## Project Architecture
- **Frontend**: React with TypeScript, using wouter for routing (converted from React Router)
- **Backend**: Express.js server with TypeScript
- **Database**: Supabase PostgreSQL (using existing user database with SupabaseStorage)
- **Authentication**: Supabase authentication integration with Discord OAuth
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with shadcn/ui components and custom space theme
- **Build Tool**: Vite with custom server setup

## Current Status
- [x] Dependencies installed (react-router-dom, @fortawesome packages, sonner, @supabase/supabase-js)
- [x] Project structure adapted for Replit compatibility
- [x] Routing system converted from React Router to wouter
- [x] Environment variables and Supabase integration secured
- [x] Application tested and verified working
- [x] Translation from Spanish to Brazilian Portuguese completed
- [x] Plans section implemented with functional navigation
- [x] Database schema integration with Supabase tables
- [x] VM Dashboard with plan-based specifications
- [x] Plan subscription and management system
- [x] User profile with subscription history
- [x] Admin panel with user management, plan stock control, and system settings
- [x] Complete admin interface with statistics and configuration options

## Key Components
