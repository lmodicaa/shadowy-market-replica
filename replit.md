# Project Migration from Lovable to Replit

## Overview
This is a full-stack JavaScript application that has been migrated from Lovable to the Replit environment. The project appears to be a web application with space/astronomy theming, featuring user authentication via Supabase, navigation, hero sections, features, and tutorials.

## Project Architecture
- **Frontend**: React with TypeScript, using wouter for routing (converted from React Router)
- **Backend**: Express.js server with TypeScript
- **Database**: Supabase PostgreSQL (using existing user database with SupabaseStorage)
- **Authentication**: Supabase authentication integration with Discord OAuth
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with shadcn/ui components and custom space theme
- **Build Tool**: Vite with custom server setup

## Current Status
- [x] Dependencies installed (react-router-dom, @fortawesome packages, sonner, @supabase/supabase-js)
- [x] Project structure adapted for Replit compatibility
- [x] Routing system converted from React Router to wouter
- [x] Environment variables and Supabase integration secured
