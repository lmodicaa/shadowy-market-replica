# Netlify Debugging Guide for MateCloud

## Problem
The application shows only "MateCloud - Carregando gaming na nuvem..." and never loads the main content.

## Root Cause Analysis
Based on the debugging logs from Replit, the React app is loading correctly here but failing in Netlify production build.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Updated index.html
- Added proper initial loader with spinner animation
- Loader gets removed immediately when React mounts
- Added inline CSS for the loader animation

### 2. Updated main.tsx 
- Enhanced error handling and logging
- Explicit loader removal before React render
- Better fallback UI in case of errors

### 3. Updated netlify.toml
- Changed to `npm ci` for faster, reliable installs
- Added CI=true environment variable
- Improved cache headers for static assets

### 4. Added client/public/_redirects
- Proper SPA routing fallback to index.html
- Static asset caching rules
- Security headers

## Deployment Steps for Netlify

1. **Environment Variables**: Make sure these are set in Netlify dashboard:
   - `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`: Your Supabase project URL
   - `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`: Your Supabase anonymous key

2. **Build Settings**: 
   - Build command: `npm ci && npm run build`
   - Publish directory: `dist/public`
   - Node version: 20

3. **File Structure**: After build, Netlify should serve:
   ```
   dist/public/
   ├── index.html (main entry point)
   ├── assets/ (JS, CSS, images)
   └── _redirects (SPA routing)
   ```

## Testing Locally
Run `npm run build` and verify:
- `dist/public/index.html` exists and has proper structure
- Assets are generated in `dist/public/assets/`
- No console errors in browser when serving the built files

## If Still Not Working
1. Check browser console for JavaScript errors
2. Verify all Supabase environment variables are set
3. Ensure build completes without errors
4. Check Netlify build logs for any missing dependencies
